# [110. Goodharts Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)

"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." - Charles Goodhart

[Campbell's law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law): "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption, pressures, and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt social processes it is intended to monitor."

Example: People deliberately dirtying a street in order to get funds for cleaning that are allocated to dirtiest neighborhoods.

Risk of overoptimizing KPI. "If you improve a product enough, you'll eventually break it."

Example: Call center has incentive to keep calls short / costs low, but this may encourage employees to hang up. 

Example: [Search Engine Optimization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), [PageRank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), [link farms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_farm), [TrustRank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_Rank)

Example: Agile can introduce bias for short term goals. Getting story points doesn't necessarily move the business forward.
