EXAMPLE

We go to a farm with pomegranates and lemons. Farmer has mixed bags of fruit, sold by weight. First 1/3: 100 % pomegranate. Second 1/3: 50% lemons / 50% pomegranates. Third 1/3: all pomegranates or all lemons. The farmer reaches into one bag and pulls out a pomegranate; therefore, this bag ins't all lemons. There's a 66% probability it's all pomegranates, and a 33% probability it's mixed.	He reaches in a second time and pulls out a second pomegranate: we now have mounting evidence. More likely that the bag is full of pomegranates than that it is 50-50.
