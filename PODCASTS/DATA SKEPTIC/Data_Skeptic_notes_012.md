## Example: San Francisco and its seven hills: How do you know you're on the highest?

## Example: optimization for a restaurant owner

* make place smaller: less rent, fewer tables, etc
* expand and have franchises
* cut the menu


## Example: Ants are trying to find shortest path to food. They wander about randomly until they find food, then they walk home releasing pheromones; the strongest smelling trail is the one the most ants have converged upon. 

Immitating nature can be a strategy when modeling.
