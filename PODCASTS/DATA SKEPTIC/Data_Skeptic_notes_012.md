## Examples: 

* San Francisco and its seven hills: How do you know you're on the highest?

* Example: optimization for a restaurant owner

1. make place smaller: less rent, fewer tables, etc
2. expand and have franchises
3. simplify the menu

* Example: Ants are trying to find shortest path to food. They wander about randomly until they find food, then they walk home releasing pheromones; the strongest smelling trail is the one the most ants have converged upon. 

Note: Immitating nature can be a strategy when modeling.
