personalized medicine definition

example of personalized medicine using cancer

cancer: "umbrella term that means a growth in your body that interferes with the functions of your body"

Five different types of breast cancer, and which a woman has is determined by individual's genetics. 

Based on background of genetic individual, customized targetting

They are trying to do biopsies on tumors.

Personalized medicine is in its early stages. 

Genome project was completed in 2001, but implications are still being debated. 

Data scientist / Kyle's look at genetics, by analogy:
	- computers are all 0's and 1's
	- something similar in genetic code
	- genetics is base 4
	- codon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code
	- each codon is a single instruction
	- genetic codes are resilient, unlike computer codes
	- within generations there are mutations
	- an individual's genome is a unique number

Kyle: How do we define what a species is based on a number?

Niki: Most species are defined based on anatomical characteristics; we're entering era when species are defined based on genomic sequence. 

Kyle: "I've heard it said that personalized medicine enables more efficient and effective clinical trials" -- why is this true?

Niki: Currently develop drugs by identifying the molecular mechanism / celular pathway that when it's [inaudible]. Then find chemical compounds that can stop this: the drug. Having identified the drug, clinical trials, confirming that actual drug doesn't cause harm. 

Clinical trials need to be tailored to include the 1 / 1000th people that carry a given mutation. Otherwise drug might be discarded despite being a good drug for a very small percent.

Must be careful that cherry-picking patients does not disguise potential negative effects of drug. 

Kyle: How is this detected?

Niki: one way is through repeated testing with randomization.

Kyle: If I can pick my test cases, how do I control for all these other hidden variables I might not know about?

Niki: There are protocols. Try to match control group for age, ethnicity, sex. 

Kyle: Why isn't any random-base pair in the genome is fair game for control?

Niki: I wish we understood the genome well enough to do this. 


Kyle: Cellular pathways -- what are the cellular pathways correllated with a disease?


Niki: There are mutations associated with breast cancer, and these can be used to, say, recommend a double-mastectomy. 

Kyle: What about false positives?

Niki: Conservative approach is to apply Bonferroni correction to data. Also widely used is the permutation approach, where genomes are randomized. Third approach is when you have specific genes: prinicipal component analysis. 

Principal component analysis: a machine learning approach where you try to find the grouping that minimizes the difference.

Kyle: Suprised you'd use the Bonferroni correction. Would seem you wouldn't get results at all. 

Niki: Just increase your sample size.

Kyle: Getting less expensive to do personal genomic work. 

Niki: I think the current price for sequencing your whole genome is ~$1000.

Kyle: What advantage does that give me? What benefit would I derive?

Niki: There are very few diseases...we do have some associations of specific mutations with diseases...you could potentially prevent a disease...The truth is I don't think we really have much to gain right...perhaps in the future. 


Kyle: Human Genome Project -- whose genome did they sequence?

Niki: Just a template. Helped identify most common mutations.


Kyle: Seems like the very wealthy / first-world countries can do a lot of sequencing work. Are poor / people in third-world countries are at a disadvantage for personalized medicine?


Niki: Frequency of blood types varies between Asians, whites, blacks. Men are more studied than women because men have y chromosome. 


Kyle: New Scientist 2012 Harris Poll: doctors recommended personalized genetic tests for only 4% of patients. Is this a case of slow adoption, or early adopters who can afford a high cost, or is this a genuine criticism of efficacy?

Niki: Slow adoption. But also because our knowledge is still very limited. 

Kyle: One of strengths of personalized medicine is that it can be predictive and therefore proactive vs traditional medicine which tends be reactive. How do we isolate the genuine causes for concern?

Niki: All correllations come with probabilities. 

Kyle: How can big data advance personalized medicine?

Niki: Personalized medicine is big data. The genome is [huge]. Control group typically consists of a 1000 individuals. 


Kyle: What tools and technologies are supporting these things?

Niki: I'm not working with humans. I'm working with [inaudible].

RNA sequencing

epigenome: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenome

monozygotic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin#Monozygotic_.28identical.29_twins

One gene might be mutated. But if there's a similar gene, it might take over. This is usually understood through RNA sequencing, not DNA sequencing. 

Kyle: What does it mean that a gene is expressed?

Niki: Only 1 - 2 % of our genome is genes. The rest is either stuff we don't understand or stuff we understand but we have no clue what they're doing there, or regulatory sequences. Every gene can make thousands of millions of RNA molecules. 

Kyle: Would it be fair to say that the environment influences [this]?

Niki: In biology environment refers to what's around the cells, and this is affected by what we eat and drink.

Kyle: Where do you see thinks in 10 years, 50 years, 100 years?

Niki: Genome Project came in ahead of schedule because project ignited innovation. Next 10 years, lots of genome studies, personalized medicine questions, metagenomics (sequencing the microbes within us)

Kyle: Perhaps we can simulate clinical trials in the future using a model. Is that science fiction or a possibility?

Niki: Sounds like science fiction. 

Kyle: What are open challenges biologists are having that technologists might solve?

Niki: The region that does not encode the genome is not understood: biologists and bioinformaticists are trying to understand this.


Kyle: Is this what the Folding at Home Project is trying to solve?

Niki: Yes.
